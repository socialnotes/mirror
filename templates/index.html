      <h3>F.A.Q.</h3>
      <article>
        <p><strong>How to upload?</strong> It dead simple.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Browse to the directory you find more suitable for your file.</li>
          <li>Click on "Upload a new file in this directory" by the end of the <em>content list</em>.
          <li>Fill the form that will appear.</li>
          <li>Click on the confirm link that will be sent you by email.</li>
        </ol>
      </article>

      <article>
        <p><strong>Are there any preferred formats?</strong> Sure!<br>
          Actually it would be better for the files to be in
          <strong>plain-text</strong> (.txt, c, <em>etc.</em>) or
          <strong>.pdf</strong> (scans, converted .ppt, .doc, <em>etc.</em>)
          <strong>Why?</strong> 1. <em>Portability</em> 2. <em>Indexing</em>.
          <strong>But</strong> if it's not possible, or easy, or meaningful,
          or simply you do not have time to target this format your notes
          are welcome anyway in the original format
          (other will take care of the conversion if necessary).
